          <div>Mark Hamill needs little introduction. As Luke Skywalker,
            he was the heart of the original Star Wars trilogy, making us laugh,
            cry, and cheer as he depicted a hero’s journey from boy to man.
            His range in the films is impressive: playing the straight man to a
            couple of anxious robots; acting as an impatient student opposite a
            small, strange, green puppet; emerging as a confident, powerful warrior
            who must save his father’s soul.</div>
          <div><img src="mark-hamill.png"></div>
          <div>He made us believe in it all, and Star
          Wars would not be Star Wars without Hamill’s gifts. (He’s also a
          supremely talented voice actor, and is the Joker for a generation of
          Batman fans.</div>
